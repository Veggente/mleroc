# mleroc
mleroc (pronounced melee rock) is an ML estimator of optimal ROC curves.

Use the following steps to reproduce the figures in the paper ["Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Optimal Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves From Likelihood Ratio Observations" by Hajek and Kang](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01956).
1. Install Python 3.9 with packages `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and `tqdm`.
1. Use `python unbalance.py` to reproduce Figure 1.
